                    <h2>Photography</h2>
                    <p>I enjoy playing around with cameras and making photos. Iâ€™m currently serving as the President of the Photography Club of my high school. My photoblog is a formal display of my skills as a photographer. While Instagram gets a bit of everything, work which I consider more serious makes its way here.</p>
